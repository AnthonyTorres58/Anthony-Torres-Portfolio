# SQL Queries

A compilation of some sample queries I wrote using the AdventureWorks2014 database.
Premises and the SQL queries that solve them were written by me.
I uploaded both .docx and .pdf files.

Format is : (Premise) -> (Problem Solving Query) -> (Sample Output)


You can retrieve AdventureWorks2014 from:

## Types of Queries

These quieries have been split into 3 categories based on their complexity and placed into their respective folders. Read below to see what the differences are. 

### **"Simple" Queries**
 A simple query has up to 2 tables joined.

### **"Medium" Queries**
 A medium query has from 2 to 3 tables joined and includes the use of built-in SQL functions/group by summarization. 

### **"Complex" Queries**
 A Complex query has from 3 or more tables joined, a custom scalar function and uses built-in SQL functions and group by summarization.
